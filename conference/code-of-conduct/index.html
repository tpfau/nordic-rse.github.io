    <h1 id="code-of-conduct">Code of conduct</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>This code of conduct is copied and adapted from the code of conduct used at the
<a href="https://www.software.ac.uk/cw20/code-conduct">Collaborations Workshop 2020</a>
(CC-BY-NC 2.5 license) which was adapted from the example policy at the
<a href="https://geekfeminism.wikia.org/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy">Geek Feminism wiki</a>,
created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers (CC-0 license).
The procedure for reporting harassment has been adopted from the Ada Initiative's guide titled
<a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Responding_to_reports">&quot;workshop anti-harassment/Responding to Reports&quot;</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We value the participation of each stakeholder and want all participants to
have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all participants are
expected to show respect and courtesy to other participants throughout the
event and through all communication channels.</p>
<p>To make clear what is expected, all participants, speakers, exhibitors,
organisers and volunteers at Nordic-RSE are required to conform to the
following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the
event.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for
everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.</p>
<p>All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including
people of many different backgrounds.</p>
<p>Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees.</p>
<p>Behave professionally. Remember that harassment, unprofessional remarks and
messages, and exclusionary jokes are not appropriate at the Nordic-RSE
conference.</p>
<p>Participants violating these rules may be asked to leave the conference without
a refund at the sole discretion of the conference organisers.</p>
<p>Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.</p>
<h3 id="clarifications">Clarifications</h3>
<p>Harassment includes offensive communication related to gender, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual
images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following,
harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other
events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply
immediately.</p>
<p>Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that words can be offensive
to those around you. Offensive jokes are not acceptable at the Nordic-RSE
conference. Excessive swearing is not appropriate at this event.</p>
<p>If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the
workshop organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including
warning the offender or expulsion from the workshop with no refund.</p>
<h3 id="procedure-for-reporting-harassment">Procedure for reporting harassment</h3>
<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have
any other concerns, please contact any member of the code of conduct committee:</p>
<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-warning">
  <p>
    Here we will list members of the code of conduct committee.
  </p>
</div>
<p>Report the harassment incident via email to a member of the code of conduct
committee. All reports are confidential.</p>
<p>When reporting the event to a code of conduct committee member, try to gather
as much information as available, but do not interview people about the
incident. The committee member will assist you in writing the report/collecting
information.</p>
<p>The important information we need consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifying information (name) of the participant doing the harassing</li>
<li>The behaviour that was in violation</li>
<li>The approximate time of the behaviour (if different than the time the report was made)</li>
<li>The circumstances surrounding the incident</li>
<li>Other people involved in the incident</li>
</ul>
<p>The code of conduct committee is well informed on how to deal with the incident
and how to further proceed with the situation.  All of our committee members
are informed of the code of conduct policy and guide for handling harassment at
the workshop. There will be a mandatory code of conduct committee meeting just
prior to the event when this will be reiterated as well.</p>
